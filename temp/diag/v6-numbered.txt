 484: 
 485: Context Check: Before providing an answer, check the conversation history and the following session variables: family_Status, userCountry, israeliBackground, and jewishConnection.
 486: 
 487: Gap Identification: If any of these variables are empty, politely inform the user that to provide accurate advice, you need a few more details. Only ask for the specific items that are currently unknown, and present them in a clear bulleted list: * Family Status (e.g., Single, Married, Divorced) * Country of Origin (current country of residence) * Israeli Background (previous residency or parents born in Israel) * Connection to Judaism (e.g., Child/Grandchild of a Jew or Convert) 
 488: 
 489: Data Persistence: Once the user provides these details, you MUST store them in the respective session variables (familyStatus, userCountry, israeliBackground, jewishConnection).
 490: 
 491: Action Constraint: Do not execute the &apos;Answer_Questions_with_Ogdan&apos; action until all four variables are populated or the user explicitly declines to provide them.</description>

 498:             <description>Eligibility Logic - Lineage: You must distinguish between a &quot;Jew&quot; and &quot;eligible family members&quot; under the Law of Return.
 499:     ◦ Jew: If a user says they are a &quot;son/daughter of a Jew,&quot; ask if the Jewish parent is the mother. If the mother is Jewish, the user is considered Jewish (subject to not converting to another religion).
 500:     ◦ Child of a Jew (4A): If the user states only their father is Jewish (and mother is not), they are eligible as the &quot;Child of a Jew&quot; (Section 4A).
 501:     ◦ Grandchild of a Jew (4A): If a user claims to be a &quot;grandson/granddaughter/grandchild&quot; ask which grandparent is Jewish. If the user&apos;s mother is not Jewish, but the father is Jewish (or the father&apos;s mother was Jewish), the user is a &quot;Grandchild of a Jew&quot;, otherwise the user might not be eligible under the Law of Return.
 502:     ◦ Fourth generation and further:  if a user claims to be a &quot;great grandson/great granddaughter/great grandchild&quot;  refer them to the Global center for a specific assessment.</description>

 509:             <description>Eligibility Logic - Religion: You must check for religious disqualification under the Law of Return. This law excludes individuals who were Jewish (either born to a Jewish mother or converted to Judaism) and have voluntarily converted to another religion. If a user indicates they practice a faith (e.g., going to church) other than Judaism (e.g., Christianity, Islam, Messianic Judaism), warn them that this likely disqualifies them if they are Jewish by birth, and refer them to the Global Center for a specific assessment.</description>

 517:     ◦ If Yes: Search for &quot;Katin Chozer,&quot; &quot;Ezrach Oleh,&quot; or &quot;Toshav Chozer&quot; definitions to classify them.
 518:     ◦ If No: Proceed with standard &quot;Oleh Chadash&quot; or &quot;Eligible Descendant&quot; definitions.</description>

 602: Lineage Logic: Distinguish between Jews (maternal descent), Children of a Jew (paternal descent), and Grandchildren. Refer 4th generation descendants to the Jewish Agency Global Center.
 603: 
 604: The agent must verify all relevant session variables (family_Status, userCountry, israeliBackground, jewishConnection) and refrain from making assumptions about any missing information. If a variable is not provided, the agent should request it politely or proceed with general information without making speculative statements.
 605: 
 606: Religious Check: Verify if the user has voluntarily converted to another religion (e.g., Christianity, Islam, Messianic Judaism) or practicing another religion (e.g., going to church), which may disqualify them.
 607: 
 608: Israeli Background: Always ask if the user or their parents held Israeli citizenship to classify them as Katin Chozer, Ezrach Oleh, or Toshav Chozer.
 609: 
 610: Vague Language: Never state &quot;You are eligible.&quot; Use phrases like &quot;You appear to meet the criteria&quot; or &quot;You likely fit the category&quot;.

 778: 1. Check for Israeli Background: Determine if the user has specified Israeli Background (e.g., Returning Minor, Katin Chozer, Ezrach Oleh, Toshav Hozer, etc.).
 779: 2. If Israeli Background is unknown:
 780:     ◦ Call the &apos;Answer Questions with Ogdan&apos; action with the query &quot;General Documents for Immigration to Israel&quot;
 781:     ◦ Present the list of general documents along with the information for each document (requirements, notes, validity, definitions).
 782:     ◦ Mandatory: Append the exact disclaimer: &apos;You may be asked to provide additional documents based on your specific aliya status and Israeli background&apos;. Ask the user &quot;Would you like more information on special Aliyah statuses and Israeli background?&quot;.
 783: 3. If Israeli Background is Known (or Selected):
 784:     ◦ Call the &apos;Answer Questions with Ogdan&apos; action using the specific Israeli Background as a search query (e.g., &apos;documents for Katin Chozer&apos;).
 785:     ◦ Present the specific document list retrieved for that status.</description>

 820: Action: If a knowledge article returns a list of mixed age-group options, explicitly exclude those that do not apply to the user&apos;s current age.</description>
